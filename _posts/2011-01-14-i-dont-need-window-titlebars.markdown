Why? Because they waste space and I rarely use them.

There are only three buttons (sometimes an extra button for the window menu)
and a title on this bar. The close button is probably used the most, but all
of the functionality that resides in the titlebar can be integrated into the
taskbar or some keyboard shortcuts.

The window title can be displayed in the taskbar item of the window. A
right-button mouse click can close the window or show a menu with some options.
Scroll-down and scroll-up can minimize and restore the window. With some
keyboard shortcuts you can do the same.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Shortcut</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Close</td>
      <td>Super + c</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maximize</td>
      <td>Super + d</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fullscreen</td>
      <td>Super + f</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Move</td>
      <td>Alt + Left mouse button</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resize</td>
      <td>Alt + Right mouse button</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Browse windows</td>
      <td>Alt + Tab</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Some examples in the above table. *Super* is the *Windows key*. It'll probably
make you faster in handling your windows.

I think in most standalone window managers you can disable the title bar and
configure some keyboard shortcuts, but getting rid of the titlebars in
[Xfce][2] and [Gnome][3] wasn't easy. The only way I could find was editing the
theme. It's too much work when you want to use an other theme. Not cool.

That's one way to get 10-15px extra screen space. Another way to get ~30px more
space is putting your taskbar on the left or right side on your screen. Most
displays are widescreen these days and you'll have more vertical space that way.

[Tint2][1] is a good taskbar. It's very easy to configure. I placed it on the
right side of my display and it displays all workspaces with all running
applications displayed as icons.

I also like Apple's taskbar. The program menu (file, edit, etc.) is integrated
into the taskbar and with the Finder menu you can select a running application
if I remember it correctly. It's been more than 4 years ago since I used a Mac.
At my old school they used Mac OS X.

Hmm, I guess that's it.
