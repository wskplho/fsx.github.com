Today I present a new release of Momoko, version 0.3.0. It's been a while ago
since I released 0.2.0 (three months ago). I'll blame on school and my vacation. ;)

The following changes have been made:

 * Renamed `momoko.Momoko` to `momoko.Client`.
 * Programming in blocking-style is now possible with `AdispClient`.
 * Support for Python 3 has been added.
 * The batch and chain fucntion now accepts different arguments. See the
   documentation for details.

The nicest addition is that you can now query the database without using callbacks.
This is possible by using [adisp][0]. Here are some examples:

{% highlight python %}
cursor = yield self.db.execute('SELECT 42, 12, 40, 11;')

cursors = yield self.db.batch({
    'query1': ['SELECT 42, 12, %s, %s;', (23, 56)],
    'query2': 'SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;',
    'query3': 'SELECT 465767, 4567, 3454;'
})

cursors = yield self.db.chain((
    ['SELECT 42, 12, %s, 11;', (23,)],
    'SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;'
))
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see there is a `yield` keyword. You also need to put an extra decorator
on your get/post/somethingelse function, `momoko.process`. That's all.

View the updated [documentation on momoko.61924.nl][1] and download the new
release from [PyPi][2].

Have fun.
