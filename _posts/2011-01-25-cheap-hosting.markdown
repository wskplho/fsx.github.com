I decided to close my Webfaction account and search for a cheaper alternative
since I wasn't using it that much and the numbers on my bank account were
getting smaller. [Webfaction][1] is still a very good shared host. And they
have a great helpdesk.

My domain has been moved from Idotz to [Nedlinux][2]. This saves me about 10
euros and I also have whois protection + full DNS control. And till now their
service is good.

Google Apps is used for email. I haven't been able to find a email client, web-
or desktop-based, that beats the Gmail interface. And it makes it even more
awesome after I found [a blog post that explains how to enable multiple sign-ins][3].

All the content and code is hosted on [Github][4]. Once I push new changes,
Jekyll generates fresh HTML and stuff and my website is updated. And since it
doesn't make sense to store images in Git that won't change, the images are
stored on [Dropbox][5]. Besides that it'll probably fill my Github account
faster than I want.

And this saves about 100 euros a year and the only thing I have to pay now is
15 euros a year for the domain. *Yay!*
