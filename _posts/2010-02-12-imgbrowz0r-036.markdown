    <li><strong>Update September 27th, 2009:</strong> Another vulnerability
    was found in <strong>0.3.5</strong>. Please upgrade to <strong>0.3.6</strong>.
    The download link in this post has been updated.</li>
</ul>

This release has fixed a directory traversal vulnerability and has some speed
improvements (~15% on my development server).

Here is the changelog:

 - Renamed index.php to example.php.
 - Fixed directory traversal vulnerability. Fixed by **bc**.
 - *sort_order* options need different values. See example.php for information.
 - Some small optimizations (e.g. scandir instead of readdir).
 - Removed the filesize_limit option. This slowsdown everything and a user should
   be able to check his/her photos or other images before he puts them online.
 - **Fixed directory traversal vulnerability (again). Reported by Secunia Research.**

The latest release can be downloaded from the [downloads page](http://github.com/FSX/imgbrowz0r/downloads)
on Github.
