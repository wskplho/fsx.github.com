A bit late, but it's here, ImgBrowz0r **0.3.7**. Even though this is a minor
release I added some new features. Like caching, sort by Exif date and a crop
mode for thumbnails. And also some other stuff. Here's the changelog:

 - Added "sort by EXIF DateTimeOriginal." Patch provided by bc.
 - Replaced scandir() with DirectoryIterator.
 - The timezone configuration option now accepts a valid TZ database timezone
   or `false`. When `false` is used the timezone setting will be skipped.
 - The enable_dst configuration option has been dropped.
 - Do not check if GD is enabled anymore.
 - Renamed the `imgbrowz0r` class to `ImgBrowz0r`.
 - Added small, optional, replaceable caching class.
 - A better pagination function.
 - Use P tags instead of DIV tags to wrap the breadcrumbs, pagination and statistics.
 - All files in the cache are now writeable by everyone. This ensures you can
   remove the cache files generated by the PHP/Apache user with your FTP client.
 - Added crop mode. This mode crops a random part of the image. (experimental)

First "crop mode." I couldn't think of a cooler name, but it is cool. Instead
of resizing the whole image to a thumbnail it cuts out a random piece of the
image and uses that to create the thumbnail. It's not working perfectly yet
(with smaller images), but it works fine with normal photo-size images. Here's
an example:

<a class="jsimgbox" href="{{ site.cdn }}/img/imgbrowz0r/imgbrowz0r_crop_mode.png">
  <img src="{{ site.cdn }}/img/imgbrowz0r/t_imgbrowz0r_crop_mode.png" alt="ImgBrowz0r Crop Mode" />
</a>

Second, sorting with Exif data. ImgBrowz0r uses the [Exif][1] PHP extension to
extract the necesarry data from Jpeg images and uses `DateTimeOriginal` to sort
the images. When Exif is not available the timestamp from the filesystem will
be used.

Third. Timezones can now be configured with the `time_zone` option and accepts
a TZ timezone which can be found in the [List of tz database time zones][2].
This should also take care DST.

And the last one, the cache. You won't notice any difference with small
galleries, but with larger galleries you will. The cache is optional
and, if you want, you can also use you own caching class.

Information and install/update/usage instructions can be found in the tarball
which **can be downloaded from [the download page][3]**.
