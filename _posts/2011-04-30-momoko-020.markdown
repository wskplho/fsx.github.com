A new version of the [asynchronous Psycopg wrapper for Tornado][1]. Here is the
list of changes for this release:

 - Removed `executemany` from `Momoko`, because it can not be used in asynchronous mode.
 - Added a wrapper class, `Momoko`, for `Pool`, `BatchQuery` and `QueryChain`.
 - Added the `QueryChain` class for executing a chain of queries (and callables)
   in a certain order.
 - Added the `BatchQuery` class for executing batches of queries at the same time.
 - Improved `Pool._clean_pool`. It threw an `IndexError` when more than one
   connection needed to be closed.

And some documentation has been put online at [momoko.61924.nl][4]. Momoko
can be downloaded from [PyPi][2] and [Github][3].
