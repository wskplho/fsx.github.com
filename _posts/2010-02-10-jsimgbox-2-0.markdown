I't finally done. Well, it was already done last week, but it didn't work in
Internet Explorer for some reason.

It looks like (still) IE doesn't support `getElementsByClassName()`, while all
the other browsers support it. I don't know what the reason for that decision
is, but it's quite annoying.

Jsimgbox is a really simple Lightbox clone. It just shows an image and that's it.
And it's only **1.552KB** when it's compressed with [YUI Compressor][1].

It doesn't need a Javascript library like jQuery or Mootools. The old version, 0.2,
does need Mootools, but the current version, 2.0, doesn't.

This script has been tested in:

 - Chromium 4.0.249.78 (36714) (Linux)
 - Swiftfox 3.6 (Linux)
 - Midori 0.2.2 (GTK+ 2.18.5, WebKitGTK+ 1.1.15) (Linux)
 - Opera 10.20 Alpha 1 (Build 4744) (Linux)
 - Internet Explorer 8 (Windows ?)
