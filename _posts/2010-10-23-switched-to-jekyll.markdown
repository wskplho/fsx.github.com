This website is now generated by [Jekyll][] and hosted on Github. It takes too
much time to make a decent application for myself and that's partly because of
the lack of motivation. Making a simple blog application isn't very exciting.
I can spend that time on other projects that are more important.

I first tried [Posterous][], but it didn't really work out. Didn't like the
WYSIWYG editor and the syntax highlighter couldn't process certain pieces of
code.

Anyway, Jekyll (+ Github) was the winner.
