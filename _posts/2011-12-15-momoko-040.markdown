A new release of Momoko! This time it's 0.4.0. It took a while, but it's done
now. Here are the changes:

 * Reorganized classes and files.
 * Renamed `momoko.Client` to `momoko.AsyncClient`.
 * Renamed `momoko.Pool` to `momoko.AsyncPool`.
 * Added a client and pool for blocking connections, `momoko.BlockingClient`
   and `momoko.BlockingPool`.
 * Added `PoolError` to the import list in `__init__.py`.
 * Added an example that uses Tornado's [gen][1] module and [Swift][2].
 * Callbacks are now optional for `AsyncClient`.
 * `AsyncPool` and `Poller` now accept a ioloop argument. [[fzzbt]][3]
 * Unit tests have been added. [[fzzbt]][3]
