[Three weeks ago][1] I installed Ubuntu 10.10 on my laptop, because I was having 
problems again with NetworkManager again on Arch Linux. I wanted something that
didn't require me fixing programs that don't give me a decent error message,
because I only use my laptop for work and school.

It took an hour or two (or three) to install and configure everything. Replacing 
programs, choosing a GTK theme, looking for a nice wallpaper. Almost no command-line 
actions were required. Only when I wanted to add some new software sources
and a kernel with the [CK patchset][2]. I don't mind doing things with a 
terminal, it even goes faster, but non-technical users like GUIs so I guess it's
a good thing.

There are some things that I don't like. Like Nautilus. It takes a while before
it appears and on top of that it's ugly. I haven't been able to find a PPA for
Thunar 1.2, but it looks like it is included in Ubuntu 11.04, so I'll wait for that
one.

It's not as responsive as the previous Arch Linux installation and the start up
time is also longer, but I'm pretty happy with it besides that. Look at that nice 
screenshot.

I'll keep Arch Linux on my desktop PC since it's much easier to change things,
it's faster (depends on what you install ofcourse), the AUR is awesome and I
have the time to configure stuff.
