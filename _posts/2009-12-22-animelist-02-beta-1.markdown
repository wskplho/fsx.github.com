Finally! I have been working on this for a while. Also because I rewrote it two
times. I'm still not really statisfied, but it can't be perfect on the first
release, right?

This first beta only includes (anime) list management and search plugin. I
scrapped the torrent plugin and plugin system (well, it's just hidden), because
I couldn't make them really useful. It/I needs some more time.

I know there's another similar project that uses Python and PyGTK (in the future
wxPython), but I wasn't really satisfied with it. The whole GUI froze when certain
actions are done and you can't search for anime. At that time I didn't really
know Python or PyGTK so it was easier to start something myself.

Information, manuals and downloads can be found at the
[project page](R[url]/projects#h-animelist). Have fun.

Oh, here are some old screenshots. The first one is a screenshot of my first try
and the second one is the unreleased 0.1.
