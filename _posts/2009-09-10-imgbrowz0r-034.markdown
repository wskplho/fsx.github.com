It's done and it was actually not much work. And this will be the last release
of the 0.3 branch. I will fix bugs for 0.3 until I released 0.4.

Here are the things that are fixed/changed/added:

 * Replaced str_replace() with preg_quote() for regex escaping.
 * Added separate sorting options for images and directories.
 * Made private methods/variables protected to make extending easier.
 * Added filesize limit option.
 * Added (preview) thumbnail generation for directories.
 * Changed markup for thumbnails. It'll be easier to style it with CSS.
 * Added memory peak usage to the example page (index.php). Now you can
   see how much memory GD (not ImgBrowz0r) uses.

Not that much, but there's not much to add anyway. ;)

Downloads can be found at [the Github downloads page](http://github.com/FSX/imgbrowz0r/downloads).
