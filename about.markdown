Hi, I'm Frank, 20. And I enjoy doing webdevelopment, programming,
reading/watching manga/anime and listening music. I
also do other stuff, but I'll keep that to myself. :)

I'm using this website to improve my english and writing 'skills' by writing
blog posts and to host some information about my projects. I don't write
much, but I still write something...

My current desktop. [Openbox][], [Tint2][] and [Conky][] on [Archlinux][].
You can also take a look at the [list of software](/software.html) I use.
