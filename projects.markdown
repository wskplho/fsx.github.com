<h2 id="h-active-projects">Active <a class="h-link" href="#h-active-projects">¶</a></h2>

It means that I still support these projects and work on them from time to time.


<h3 id="h-jsimgbox">Jsimgbox <a class="h-link" href="#h-jsimgbox">¶</a></h3>

Jsimgbox is a really simple Lightbox clone. It just shows an image and that's
it. No special effects, slideshow or navigation. And it's only ~1.6KB when
it's compressed with the [YUI Compressor][].

<h3 id="h-imgbrowz0r">ImgBrowz0r <a class="h-link" href="#h-imgbrowz0r">¶</a></h3>

A simple gallery class that's written in PHP5. It can be integrated into a
website, cms or blog, but it also runs good as a standalone gallery.

<h3 id="h-php-utf8">PHP-UTF8 <a class="h-link" href="#h-php-utf8">¶</a></h3>

PHP-UTF-8 is a UTF-8 aware library of functions mirroring PHP's own string
functions. Does not require PHP mbstring extension though will use it, if found,
for a (small) performance gain.

This is a fork from [Phputf8 at Sourceforge][oldphputf8]. And this is an attempt
to update the library and keep it working for Shinobu and FluxBB.

<h3 id="h-nene">Nene <a class="h-link" href="#h-nene">¶</a></h3>

Nene is a simple IRC-bot. It's just a project for fun to improve my knowledge
of Python and networking. The first implementation uses Asyncore, which is almost
finished.

<h2 id="h-inactive-projects">Inactive <a class="h-link" href="#h-inactive-projects">¶</a></h2>

These projects are inactive, because I don't have time for them or I don't need
them anymore. It is possible that I might pick it again, but anyone is free to
take over a project.


<h3 id="h-animelist">AnimeList <a class="h-link" href="#h-animelist">¶</a></h3>

**Note:** AnimeList is still buggy. I can't guarantee it works perfectly.

AnimeList is an desktop application for MynimeList.net written in Python (and
PyGTK). It enabled you to manage your list with anime and search through anime.

<h3 id="h-shinobu">Shinobu <a class="h-link" href="#h-shinobu">¶</a></h3>

Shinobu is a simple CMS/framework written in PHP and uses MySQLi for storage.
It is currently under development and an alpha has been released. The website
of the old Shinobu (0.2) can be found at [shinobu.61924.nl][]. It will be
updated once 0.4 is released.
