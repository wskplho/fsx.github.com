<h1>Renamed Pantyshot to Misaka</h1>
<h2>03 Jul 2011</h2>
</header>
<p>Today I have renamed the Python binding for Upskirt, Pantyshot, to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/misaka">Misaka</a>.
Yesterday and today I received some messages from people who had a problem with
the name I chose for my Python package. And I also found out that Steve Holden
wrote a <a href="http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2011/07/childish-behavior.html">blogpost</a> about it.</p>

<p>I chose the name, because I thought it was funny. I also talked to some people
to check if it wasn&#39;t offensive or plain weird (they thought it was funny too).
The name followed the same theme as the library I used, Upskirt. I did not mean
to cause people problems with the name I had chosen.</p>

<p>It surprised me that people who had problems with the name
didn&#39;t contact me about it. Instead I saw the blog post after someone emailed me
about it. And after I commented on that blogpost I received two more messages.</p>

<p>In response to the last two messages I changed the name as soon as possible.
And everything is alright now and both sides learned something. I should not
let my perverted mind create project names and think how it might influence
other people. And the other people should now know that they should communicate
directly about problems.</p>
