Just a list of software I use. It's not complete, I just added the things that
came to mind after one moment of thinking. More stuff will probably be added
later.

 - **[Openbox][]** is a highly configurable, next generation window manager with extensive standards support.

 - **[Tint2][]** is a simple panel/taskbar unintrusive and light (memory / cpu / aestetic). We try to get
   'virtual desktop' and 'multi-monitor' easier to use. We follow freedesktop specifications.

 - **[Rxvt-unicode][]** is a fork of the well known terminal emulator rxvt.

 - **[Atool][]** is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar, tar+gzip, zip etc).

   text editor for Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.

   alike) containing jpeg/png/xpm/gif/bmp images, which aims at speed,
   convenience and ease of use.

 - **[Viewnior][]** is an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast and
   elegant. It's minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for your images.

   native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.

   features like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features like
   support for MPlayer filters and more.
